# Crypto-Suite
A simple interface for pycrypto that accepts any text file and outputs an encrypted version using AES, DES, and 3DES, in CBC and CTR modes of operation. For acedemic purposes ONLY, not considered secure.A secure version of this tool would 
accept input from a user to establish proper keys, IVs, and counters. All of these values are currently hardcoded into the program.
